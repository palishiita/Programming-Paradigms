Show how to use abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation and explain your solution:

Abstraction: Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information
to the user. Abstraction can be achieved with abstract classes. Here Car is an abstract class. to ac

Inheritance: Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes. SportsCar

through getters and setters. A setter updates the value of a variable, while a getter reads the value of a variable.
