----- JAVA OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ----

1. What is the difference between multiple and multilevel inheritance? Please provide examples of both (pseudocode)
- Multiple Inheritance is when a class inherits more than one base class. (2 class level)
  i.e. child class inherits from 2 parent classes. java does not support multiple Inheritance.
  pseudocode:
    public class A {
       void A { print "A"}
    }
    public class B {
       void B { print "B"}
    }
    public class C extends A, B {
        void C { print "C"}
    }

- Multilevel Inheritance is when a class inherits from a derived class making that derived class a base class for a
  new class. (3 class levels)
  i.e. child class inherits from parent class. parent class inherits from grandparent class
  pseudocode:
  public class A {
     void A { print "A"}
  }
  public class B extends A {
     void B { print "B"}
  }
  public class C extends B {
      void C { print "C"}
  }


2. Please describe differences between overloading and overriding.
- Overloading occurs when two or more methods in the "same class" have the "same name but different parameters".
- Overriding occurs when the "method signature is the same" in parent class and child class.

3. What is the difference between default, public, private and protected access modifiers? (Describe access from own
   class, derived class and other classes.)

4. What is the use of "finalize"?
- finalize() method is used to perform clean-up processing just before an object is garbage collected
  and is executed just before the object is destroyed.
