- The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic example of a problem in concurrent programming.

There are different solutions to the Dining Philosophers problem. Here are a few:
- One solution is to have the philosophers take turns eating. This ensures that no two philosophers try to pick up the
  chopsticks at the same time, which prevents deadlocks.
- Another solution is to have the philosophers take turns picking up the chopsticks. For example, one philosopher might
  be allowed to pick up the left chopstick first, and then the right chopstick. The next philosopher would be allowed to
  pick up the right chopstick first, and then the left chopstick. This ensures that no two philosophers try to pick up
  the same chopstick at the same time, which prevents deadlocks.
- A third solution is to use a "lock" or a "mutex" to synchronize the philosophers. A lock is a mechanism that allows
  only one philosopher to pick up the chopsticks at a time. A mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") is a special type of
  lock that allows multiple philosophers to pick up the chopsticks, but only if they do so one at a time. This ensures
  that no two philosophers try to pick up the same chopstick at the same time, which prevents deadlocks.
- Another solution is to use a "semaphore" to synchronize the philosophers. A semaphore is a special type of lock that
  allows multiple philosophers to pick up the chopsticks, but only if there are enough chopsticks available. For example,
  if there are five philosophers and five chopsticks, a semaphore could be used to allow each philosopher to pick up a
  chopstick. This ensures that no two philosophers try to pick up the same chopstick at the same time, which prevents
  deadlocks.
